SplitViewExample
================

OS X "Notes" and "Mail" app implement NSSplitView in different fashion.

This sample app contains both implementation that simulate both behavior.

Check these 2 source files for detail of each implementation:

* DelegationSplitViewWindowController - NSSplitViewDelegate implementation that simulate "Mail" app
* AutoLayoutSplitViewWindowController - auto layout NSSplitView implementation that simulate "Notes" app

Please check the [wiki](https://github.com/billibala/SplitViewExample/wiki) on why the classes are implemented the way they are.
